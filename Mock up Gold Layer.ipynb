       "When using an low-latency device (e.g. Optane drive) together with normal flash devices in a mirror, the reads should preferentially (almost always) go to the low-latency device, with the other flash devices just acting as redundancy.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "A typical use-case for such a mirror is as the allocation classes special vdev, i.e. for meta-data and small files.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "With #4334 this was handled for asymmetric mirrors consisting of SSD+HDD combinations, by using the hint from the linux kernel that HDDs are rotational, while SSDs are not, and then preferentially use the non-rotational device (SSD).  This heuristic however does not work when all involved deviced are non-rotational flash.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "A workaround is possible by marking the slower devices as rotational in the kernel (`echo 1 > /sys/block/sdX/queue/rotational`), before importing the pool.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "It would be nice if such a hint about individual devices can be provided within OpenZFS, similar to the write-mostly mark in linux software raid.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "Alternatively, it would perhaps be possible to use the response time statistics already available in the linux kernel, as shown by `r_await` with `iostat -x` to dynamically choose a prefered device, when the response times differ significantly.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "### How will this feature improve OpenZFS?\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "Better performance at lower cost (only one low-latency device needed per mirror).\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "### Additional context\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "SSD and normal NVME devices typically have read latencies around 100 microseconds.  Optane devices have latencies around 10 microseconds.  This can have a considerable impact on read performance:\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "On one tested filesystem without and with the above workaround, listing all files (`time find . -type f > allfiles.txt`) shrunk from 23.1 to 16.5 seconds after fresh pool import.  Also, having preselected a list of 10000 files (most of them small), reading them (`cat allfiles_10000_1.txt | time xargs -n 100 md5sum > /dev/null`) was reduced from 10.9 to 7.1 seconds.  A 30-35 % improvement.  (In this test, 5 % of the used space is in the allocation class special device.)  \r\n",

       "Having a consumption rate limiter for a table is beneficial in two ways:\r\n",
       "1. Currently offline tables can be configured to have storage quota. The storage quota for tables safegaurds the pinot cluster hosting those tables in case of excessive uploads of offline segments so that the cluster won't be under provisioned. Consumption rate limiter can play similar role for hybrid tables and realtime-only tables as it limits the amount of data being ingested into the realtime tables.\r\n",
       "2. Bursty pattern of incoming Kafka events introduces long time GC pauses on Pinot server. This behavior has been observed in some tables in LinkedIn. It's also been reported in this issue: #6138.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "This PR introduces rate limit on Kafka consumption which can be configured in StreamConfig. The consumption rate limit parameter is defined for the whole topic and the rate limit for each partition will be simply topic rate limit divided by the partition count of that topic.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "## Testing Done\r\n",
       "- Locally added consumption rate limit to `LLCRealtimeClusterIntegrationTest` and verified the consumption rate was limited the the amount set in the table config.\r\n",

       "First of all, thanks for developing all tools around the AMR++ pipeline!\r\n",
       "I have a few questions surrounding the steps after RGI main. So RGI main seems to work well, no error there. When I run RGI main (loaded from a conda environment) simply on the command line with the file from ExtractMegaResSNP/SNP_files/fixed_snp.fasta I get sensible output in both .json and .txt file. So that all seems well. However, the pipeline doesn't function properly when there are no perfect hits found, as then no further directories are created, so no 'final' files are obtained. The first failed step in the pipeline is the SNP confirmation (as reported here https://github.com/meglab-metagenomics/amrplusplus_v2/issues/5). \r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "So my questions are:\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "- If no perfect hits are found, does this simply mean that I can continue with the original read counts from the ResistomeResults and simply remove the genes & read counts where it says SNPConfirmationRequired, since they are not confirmed? I would find this somewhat surprising though, as there are several genes for which my Gene Fraction is 100 (so should completely overlap with the reference sequence), but no perfect hits are found. This would be very important to know, as if so, I can just continue!\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "- Also by separately installing the newest RGI version just a few days ago, running it on the fasta file found in ExtractMegaResSNP/SNP_files/fixed_snp.fasta and then going through the file, no 'perfect' hits are found. This sort of strengthens the findings as well right, that no perfect hits are found and that therefore the genes requiring SNP Confirmation can be thrown out of the count matrix? Basically all hits are \"loose hit with at least 95 percent identity pushed strict\". The only strange thing is that in none of the samples I tested there would be a specific SNP confirmed, while in each sample there are quite some gene candidates requiring SNP confirmation (with huge number of hits). Or is this something you encountered before and is quite normal?\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "- Looking at the log files, it goes wrong at the \"amr_long_to_wide.py: error: argument -i/--input_files: expected at least one argument\", since the input here is supposed to be the file with perfect hits. Hope this is sufficient information about my error!\r\n",

Perhaps this is a feature request and not a bug. However, one would expect that native ARM code would typically be at least as fast as translated x86-64 code. I noticed that the [nibabel bench_finite_range.py](https://github.com/nipy/nibabel) test is much slower for the native code than translated code.

I'll just try to provide some additional information and answer some questions I received regarding the topics we had in the following [stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgWWbBUWyig).\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "### Does the use of filters break the Open-Close Principle?\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "This is a totally valid question. If the intention by using the specifications is to conform to this principle, then by adding the concept of filters, aren't we doing the opposite? We go back and update the specification by adding additional conditions.\r\n",
       "As a brief recap, the OCP predicates that we should have constructs that are open to extensions and close to changes. This means, if we need to add a \"behavior\" to a class, we should be able to do that without changing the class itself. Even more simplified, if you have switch statements and too many conditional logic; it might be a sign that the behavior is too much hardcoded, and might be refactored in a better way.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "In our case, indeed we have too many conditions within the specification, so this concern is partially true. The catch here is that we have to do with single and atomic business requirement. The user has demanded from us that we change the behavior and add an additional condition by which the customers can be queried. The requirement is that the filters on the customer's UI page be extended. Whenever you have business requirement changes, undoubtedly you will have code changes in the domain model as well. That particular specification will change only when this exact business requirement changes, and never otherwise; it's wired up to this functionality only. Even though not the perfect structure, I might say it's an acceptable solution.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "This is quite different from the case when you have to change/add/delete behavior in a \"classic\" repository, in which case in order to update one business requirement, you're forced to update a construct that holds a collection of business requirements. That clearly violates SRP and OCP.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "### Why using `ThenInclude` in one instance broke the application? What is the proper usage?\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "In one instance, while describing different usages we updated the specification by adding `ThenInclude` (as shown below), which in turn resulted in a runtime error.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "```\r\n",
       "Query.Include(x => x.Stores).ThenInclude(x => x.Address);\r\n",
       "```\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "The error here has to do with the fact that `Address` property is not navigation, but a string property. Obviously, you should not include simple properties. And, this is the same behavior that you will have by using EF directly. Including simple properties won't result in a compile-time error but a runtime error. It's up to you to be careful, make proper usage of it, and thoroughly test your queries.\r\n",
       "We can constrain this usage and throw an exception, but we don't want to alter the behavior that much. What if the EF in some further version makes use of this usage? So, the ultimate usage constraints should be the responsibility of the ORM you're using.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "### How many Include statements are OK to have?\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "This is not directly related to this package, but I'll try to answer anyhow.\r\n",
       "While creating JOINs in SQL, the real issue is not about how many tables, but the cardinality. If the dependent tables are configured as one-to-one relationships, that's quite OK. But if you're including dependent tables, where there are many rows for each principal row, then it can have quite an impact on the performance. On top of that, you should be careful what SQL queries are being produced by EF as well. The EF Core 1&2 uses split queries, while EF Core 3 uses a single query. If you have a lot of 1:n relationships and use a single query, then you might end with a \"cartesian explosion\" (consider split queries in these cases).\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "During the stream, I showcased the following specification, and the question was if this is OK?\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "```\r\n",
       "public class AwbForInvoiceSpec : Specification<Awb>\r\n",
       "{\r\n",
       "    public AwbForInvoiceSpec(int ID)\r\n",
       "    {\r\n",
       "        Query.Where(x => x.ID == ID);\r\n",
       "        Query.Include(x => x.Packages);\r\n",
       "        Query.Include(x => x.AwbCargoServices);\r\n",
       "        Query.Include(x => x.AwbPurchase);\r\n",
       "        Query.Include(x => x.CargoManifest);\r\n",
       "        Query.Include(x => x.Customer).ThenInclude(x => x.Addresses);\r\n",
       "    }\r\n",
       "}\r\n",
       "```\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "In the context of that particular application, the `Awb` has quite significant importance in the overall business workflow, and it might be a bit more complicated than it should be. First of all, the `AwbPurchase` and `CargoManifest` represent 1:1 relationships. So, we end up with two 1:n navigations. This is relatively OK if you're retrieving one Awb record (as in this case). On the other hand, if you're trying to get a list of records, then you should reconsider if you need the child collections or not. Try to measure the performance, consider the usage of the application, number of users, peak usages, etc, and then you can decide if that meets your criteria or not.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "### Anti-pattern usage\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "In the above example, the actual anti-pattern is not the usage of several Include statements, but including the `Customer`. That implies that Awb aggregate has direct navigation to the `Customer` aggregate. If you follow DDD, you should strive to have as independent aggregates as possible. If required, one particular aggregate should hold only the identifier of some other aggregate root and not have a direct reference.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "In our case, it was a deliberate design decision to break this rule (for `Customer` aggregate), in order to improve the performance in particular cases and to reduce roundtrips to DB. But, it's not something I would advise you to do. Anyhow, it's up to you to weigh the pros/cons and make your own elaborate decisions for your applications.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "### Do I need private constructors for the entities (e.g. for the EF code-first approach)\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "I got this question related to one particular scenario which happened during the stream. Once we added the `DateTime birthdate` parameter in the constructor, we were forced to add an additional parameterless constructor so the EF could work properly.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "EF requires a parameterless constructor, so it can create the instance of the entity and then populate the properties. So, it might be wise always to add one private parameterless constructor.\r\n",
       "In our case it was working totally fine without it since all the parameters were of type `string`, and EF could just pass `null` values while creating the instance. But, once the DateTime parameter was added, that was no longer true, EF no longer could create the instance.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "**[EDIT]**\r\n",
       "The above explanation is completely wrong :), so just ignore it.\r\n",
       "It turns out EF is smart enough to utilize the constructor and will try to pass the values as ctor arguments. That's how EF handles the immutability (if your props have only getters). But, the ctor arguments should be named the same as the properties. The first character can be lowercase, and that's ok, EF will map to it correctly. But, the case of the rest of the characters should be exactly the same. So, in our case, if we have named the argument `birthDate` instead of `birthdate`, would have worked with no issues.\r\n",

       "<!-- A clear and concise description of the feature proposal -->\r\n",
       "Allow `torch.diagflat` to create sparse tensors.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "## Motivation\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "<!-- Please outline the motivation for the proposal. Is your feature request related to a problem? e.g., I'm always frustrated when [...]. If this is related to another GitHub issue, please link here too -->\r\n",
       "`torch.diagflat` will return a Tensor that is sparse, but stored as a dense Tensor.\r\n",
       "It takes up a large amount of memory just to store, and for _most_ use cases of creating a diagonal matrix, it will stay mainly diagonal.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "Having the option of creating the sparse Tensor should speed up computation for large Tensors, whilst not breaking existing code. In my research, this has led to some CUDA out of memory errors that `torch.sparse_coo_tensor` avoided.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "## Pitch\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n",
       "Change `torch.diagflat` function signature to:\r\n",
       "``` python\r\n",
       " torch.diagflat(input, offset=0, sparse=False) → Tensor\r\n",
       "```\r\n",
       "This argument name could be `layout` for consistency with the [sparse docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/sparse.html), but I think this would be confusing as you might think you're declaring row/column-major here instead.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "## Alternatives\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "1. Create dense Tensor and make sparse, i.e. `torch.diagflat(input).to_sparse()` which may lead to out of memory errors\r\n",
       "1. Create Tensor individually by values via generators in torch.sparse_coo_tensor` which is less practical, e.g.:\r\n",
       "  ``` python\r\n",
       ">>> x = torch.arange(5)\r\n",
       ">>> torch.sparse_coo_tensor(torch.tensor([(i, i) for i in range(len(x))]).T, x)\r\n",

I'm not using core blocks so this could be a problem if they try to use core patterns.\r\n\r\nThe core blocks are just put in the uncategorized category, and if you click on them they are not used (the notice will go off in the editor).\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Remove core patterns and categories\r\n\r\n```php\r\nadd_action('init', 'removeCorePatterns');\r\n\r\nfunction removeCorePatterns() {\r\n        remove_theme_support('core-block-patterns');\r\n\r\n\tunregister_block_pattern_category('buttons');\r\n\tunregister_block_pattern_category('columns');\r\n\tunregister_block_pattern_category('gallery');\r\n\tunregister_block_pattern_category('header');\r\n\tunregister_block_pattern_category('text');\r\n\tunregister_block_pattern_category('uncategorized');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Register your pattern and category\r\n3. Open the editor\r\n4. Check the patterns\r\n\r\n![patterns](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8638515/98014895-7f525b80-1dfc-11eb-9809-2f763b78ceaf.png)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThere should be only one registered category with my patterns. The core patterns should be removed, not put in an uncategorized category that is shown instead.\r\n\r\n**Editor version (please complete the following information):**\r\n- WordPress version: 5.5.3\r\n- Does the website has Gutenberg plugin installed, or is it using the block editor that comes by default? default\r\n- If the Gutenberg plugin is installed, which version is it? N/A\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: MacOS 10.15.7 (19H2)\r\n - Browser: Chrome\r\n - Version: 86.0.4240.111 (Official Build) (x86_64)",

Please describe.**\r\nI am working on tooling related to sandbox management and found the `sandboxAuth` REST Resource in the Tooling REST API. I found the endpoint in the sfdx source code. Specifically in [salesforce-alm/src/lib/org/sandbox/sandboxOrgApi.ts at line 196](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforce-alm/blob/5b9fdc67081cf85958278588b115ae08fcf64f44/src/lib/org/sandbox/sandboxOrgApi.ts#L196)\r\n\r\nI cannot find any information about this REST Resource so I am concerned about how stable it is and am unsure about what it is exactly doing.\r\n\r\n**What are you trying to do**\r\nBuild tooling to orchestrate our sandbox management processes.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nDocumentation that explains the `sandboxAuth` REST Resource in the Tooling API.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI have sent requests and examined the responses. I will include notes in the additional context section below.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nFull endpoint being used: `/services/data/v50.0/tooling/sandboxAuth`\r\nI am sending a POST\r\n\r\nRequired scopes in the ConnectedApp:\r\n* Access and manage your data (api)\r\n* Full access (full)\r\n* Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)\r\n\r\nSample request:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sandboxName\":\"sbxname\",\r\n    \"clientId\":\"client_id_from_connected_app_goes_here\",\r\n    \"callbackUrl\":\"http://localhost:1717/OauthRedirect\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample response:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"authCode\":\"auth_code_that_is_returned_from_the_api\",\r\n    \"authUserName\":\"username_that_can_log_in_to_the_sandbox\",\r\n    \"instanceUrl\":\"full_instance_url_including_my_domain\",\r\n    \"loginUrl\":\"https://test.salesforce.com\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is unclear exactly what `authCode` is. Experimentation proves that it is not a Session Id or a ConnectedApp client_id. Some research suggests that it is used by SFDX in force:auth and force:org:open commands.\r\n\r\nAfter making this POST, authenticate to the sandbox using the same combination of `client_id` and `private_key` that was used to authenticate to the org that made the sandbox. The only difference is the `authUserName` from the response needs to be used because this is the username for the user in the sandbox that was just made.",

In `autokeras/auto_model.py`, I changed the `predict()` function to be \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef predict(self, x, batch_size=32, custom_objects={}, **kwargs):\r\n        \"\"\"Predict the output for a given testing data.\r\n\r\n        # Arguments\r\n            x: Any allowed types according to the input node. Testing data.\r\n            **kwargs: Any arguments supported by keras.Model.predict.\r\n\r\n        # Returns\r\n            A list of numpy.ndarray objects or a single numpy.ndarray.\r\n            The predicted results.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if isinstance(x, tf.data.Dataset):\r\n            if self._has_y(x):\r\n                x = x.map(lambda x, y: x)\r\n        self._check_data_format((x, None), predict=True)\r\n        dataset = self._adapt(x, self.inputs, batch_size)\r\n        pipeline = self.tuner.get_best_pipeline()\r\n        if custom_objects:\r\n            model = self.tuner.get_best_model(custom_objects=custom_objects)\r\n        else:\r\n            model = self.tuner.get_best_model()\r\n        dataset = pipeline.transform_x(dataset)\r\n        y = model.predict(dataset, **kwargs)\r\n        y = utils.predict_with_adaptive_batch_size(\r\n            model=model, batch_size=batch_size, x=dataset, **kwargs\r\n        )\r\n        return pipeline.postprocess(y)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in `autokeras/engine/tuner.py`, I changed the `get_best_model()` function to be\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef get_best_model(self, custom_objects={}):\r\n        with hm_module.maybe_distribute(self.distribution_strategy):\r\n            if custom_objects:\r\n                model = tf.keras.models.load_model(self.best_model_path, custom_objects=custom_objects)\r\n            else:\r\n                model = tf.keras.models.load_model(self.best_model_path)\r\n        return model\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, in the above code that I used, I replace `predictedClasses = clf.predict(xTest)` with `predictedClasses = clf.predict(xTest, custom_objects={'matthewsCorrelation': matthewsCorrelation})`. With these changes made, everything runs as I would expect.",

Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, there is no access control over user activity, and any new inexperienced user can change/add the dataset's owner, docs, depreciation status, etc. \r\nThis could be quite troublesome for even small startups and easily become unmanageable for larger organizations. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be nice even to have basic read-write access level control over users. For e.g. Only dataset owners should be allowed to edit any information pertaining to the dataset, and other users should only be allowed to read the same.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAs a quick hacky resolution, I can think of maintaining a list of read-only users in the back-end and skip their API requests to edit anything completely. This will be increasing latency for users with edit access a bit, but since the number of users is expected to be less, that might not be much of an issue.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n",

Credit to **Hubert Kario** for\n  reporting the issue. *CVE-2020-25659*\n* Support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 has been removed. Users on older version of OpenSSL\n  will need to upgrade.\n* Added basic support for PKCS7 signing (including SMIME) via\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.PKCS7SignatureBuilder`.\n<p>.. _v3-1-1:</p>\n<p>3.1.1 - 2020-09-22\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Windows, macOS, and <code>manylinux</code> wheels to be compiled with\nOpenSSL 1.1.1h.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _v3-1:</p>\n<p>3.1 - 2020-08-26</p>\n<pre><code>\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Removed support for ``idna`` based\n  :term:`U-label` parsing in various X.509 classes. This support was originally\n  deprecated in version 2.1 and moved to an extra in 2.5.\n* Deprecated OpenSSL 1.0.2 support. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is no longer supported by\n  the OpenSSL project. The next version of ``cryptography`` will drop support\n  for it.\n* Deprecated support for Python 3.5. This version sees very little use and will\n  be removed in the next release.\n* ``backend`` arguments to functions are no longer required and the\n  default backend will automatically be selected if no ``backend`` is provided.\n* Added initial support for parsing certificates from PKCS7 files with\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`\n  and\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`\n  .\n* Calling ``update`` or ``update_into`` on\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext` with ``data``\n  longer than 2\\ :sup:`31` bytes no longer raises an ``OverflowError``. This\n  also resolves the same issue in :doc:`/fernet`.\n<p>.. _v3-0:</p>\n<p>3.0 - 2020-07-20\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

In some cases this seems to not be according to the HTTP/1.1 spec and creates troubles when using for example traefik as a proxy in front of a starlette-based backend.\r\n\r\nSee this issue for details: https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/4456\r\nSpecifically, the final conclusion: https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/4456#issuecomment-593539169\r\n\r\n### To reproduce\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from starlette.responses import RedirectResponse\r\n>>> RedirectResponse(url=\"/\", status_code=302).headers\r\nMutableHeaders({'location': '/'})\r\n```\r\nHeader has not content-length field.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from starlette.responses import RedirectResponse\r\n>>> RedirectResponse(url=\"/\", status_code=302).headers\r\nMutableHeaders({'content-length': '0', 'location': '/'})\r\n```\r\nI expect there to be a content-length field specifying zero length\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from starlette.responses import RedirectResponse\r\n>>> RedirectResponse(url=\"/\", status_code=302).headers\r\nMutableHeaders({'location': '/'})\r\n```\r\nHeader has no content-length field.\r\n\r\n### Debugging material\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- OS: Linux (WSL2)\r\n- Python version: 3.8.2\r\n- Starlette version: 0.13.6\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThis bug is probably also present for other type of responses (other status-codes). Last paragraph (in bold) from https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3 is of interest:\r\n\r\n> 3.3.  Message Body\r\n> \r\n>    The message body (if any) of an HTTP message is used to carry the\r\n>    payload body of that request or response.  The message body is\r\n>    identical to the payload body unless a transfer coding has been\r\n>    applied, as described in Section 3.3.1.\r\n> \r\n>      message-body = *OCTET\r\n> \r\n>    The rules for when a message body is allowed in a message differ for\r\n>    requests and responses.\r\n> \r\n>    The presence of a message body in a request is signaled by a\r\n>    Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field.  Request message\r\n>    framing is independent of method semantics, even if the method does\r\n>    not define any use for a message body.\r\n> \r\n>    The presence of a message body in a response depends on both the\r\n>    request method to which it is responding and the response status code\r\n>    (Section 3.1.2).  Responses to the HEAD request method (Section 4.3.2\r\n>    of [RFC7231]) never include a message body because the associated\r\n>    response header fields (e.g., Transfer-Encoding, Content-Length,\r\n>    etc.), if present, indicate only what their values would have been if\r\n>    the request method had been GET (Section 4.3.1 of [RFC7231]). 2xx\r\n>    (Successful) responses to a CONNECT request method (Section 4.3.6 of\r\n>    [RFC7231]) switch to tunnel mode instead of having a message body.\r\n>    **All 1xx (Informational), 204 (No Content), and 304 (Not Modified)\r\n>    responses do not include a message body.  All other responses do\r\n>    include a message body, although the body might be of zero length.**",

(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\nNew option: `{\"propProps\": false}` (i.e. Don't error when mutating prop properties)\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <input type=\"range\" v-model.number=\"point.x\" >\r\n    <input type=\"range\" v-model.number=\"point.y\" >\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\n  export default {\r\n    props: {\r\n      point: {\r\n        type: Object,\r\n        required: true\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\nTrigger an error\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\nWhen the default option is set (`{\"propProps\": true}`), the error will trigger. When the option is set as `{\"propProps\": false}`, it will not trigger an error.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n(Note there are some issues in the past suggesting this rule be loosened (#1339 , #1314; cc @leosdad @pimlie @decademoon ); here I'm suggesting an option be added instead)\r\n\r\nMy main reason for wanting an option here, is that modifying the _reference_ of a prop (e.g. `this.myProp = 3`) will cause actual run-time warnings from Vue, cause unexpected behaviour, and is deprecated:\r\n\r\n> Due to the new rendering mechanism, whenever the parent component re-renders, the child component’s local changes will be overwritten. - https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Implicit-parent-child-communication-use-with-caution\r\n\r\nHere's the warning Vue throws:\r\n\r\n`Avoid mutating a prop directly since the value will be overwritten whenever the parent component re-renders. Instead, use a data or computed property based on the prop's value. Prop being mutated: \"number\"`\r\n\r\nModifying the _value_ of a prop (but leaving the reference the same) (e.g. `this.myProp.x = 3`), does not throw runtime warnings, and (I believe) does not cause any unexpected behaviour—it's just a code style decision. As long as the actual reference to the object remains unaltered, Vue should not have any issues. \r\n\r\nHere's a sandbox with these two cases for reference: https://codesandbox.io/s/elegant-lederberg-p1ilc\r\n\r\n(Note: This is the same way that `const` behaves in JS, so shouldn't be unexpected to most developers:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst x = 3;\r\nx = 7; // Error!\r\n\r\nconst y = {};\r\ny.foo = 3; // This is fine; it's the _reference_ that's const, not the value.\r\ny = 20; // Error\r\n```\r\n)\r\n\r\nI would love it if I could configure linting to error for reference prop modifications (which I _need_ to fix), but to ignore value prop modifications (which I often prefer using in my code). If an option is added called, say `{\"propProps\": true}`, then I would use it instead of disabling the rule entirely.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nP.S. How would one implement my code snippet above without prop value modification? The nicest way I can think of is something like this, which doesn't look particularly better to me.\r\n\r\n```vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <input type=\"range\" v-model.number=\"x\" >\r\n    <input type=\"range\" v-model.number=\"y\" >\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\n  export default {\r\n    props: {\r\n      value: {\r\n        type: Object,\r\n        required: true\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    data() {\r\n        return {\r\n            x: this.value.x,\r\n            y: this.value.y,\r\n        };\r\n    },\r\n    watch: {\r\n        // Duplicate; could create a `mounted` method and use `$watch` to watch everything\r\n        x(newVal) { this.$emit('input', { x: newVal, y: this.y } },\r\n        y(newVal) { this.$emit('input', { x: this.x, y: newVal } },\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n(Similar to https://simonkollross.de/posts/vuejs-using-v-model-with-objects-for-custom-components )\r\n\r\n",

But the deserializer was not able to deduce the type of one of my properties:\r\n`Expected argument of type \"DateTimeInterface\", \"string\" given.. `\r\nIn order to follow the name of my .xml elements, I used for one of the properties snake_case instead of CamelCase. \r\nAfter digging a bit, I found that this mix caused the deserializer not to find the correct type of the property.\r\nThe function ` getMutatorMethod` from ReflectionExtractor.php can’t determine the type because it tries to find a function named “setDate_Prox” instead of the “setDateProx”\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce**  \r\n<!-- Code and/or config needed to reproduce the problem. If it's a complex bug,\r\n     create a \"bug reproducer\" as explained in:\r\n     https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/reproducer.html -->\r\n```\r\n//Entity\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nnamespace App\\Entity;\r\n\r\nuse App\\Repository\\MyEntityRepository;\r\nuse Doctrine\\ORM\\Mapping as ORM;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @ORM\\Entity(repositoryClass=MyEntityRepository::class)\r\n */\r\nclass MyEntity\r\n{\r\n    .......... \r\n \r\n    /**\r\n     * @ORM\\Column(type=\"datetimetz\")\r\n     */\r\n    private $Timebul;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @ORM\\Column(type=\"date\")\r\n     */\r\n    private $Date_Prox;\r\n\r\n    public function setTimebul(\\DateTimeInterface $Timebul): self\r\n    {\r\n        $this->Timebul = $Timebul;\r\n        return $this;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public function setDateProx(\\DateTimeInterface $Date_Prox): self\r\n    {\r\n        $this->Date_Prox = $Date_Prox;\r\n        return $this;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\n//Controller\r\nclass HomePageController extends AbstractController\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * @Route(\"/\", name=\"home_page\", methods={\"GET\", \"POST\"})\r\n     */\r\n    public function index(Request $request ,SerializerInterface $serializer): Response\r\n    {\r\n        $data = file_get_contents(\"pathtomy.xml\");\r\n\r\n        $myEntity= $serializer->deserialize($data, MyEntity::class, 'xml');\r\n        \r\n        return $this->render('home_page/index.html.twig');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Possible Solution**  \r\n<!--- Optional: only if you have suggestions on a fix/reason for the bug -->\r\nIf this is normal behavior, the documentation should warn about this, maybe where the documentation indicate that you can use the converter between CamelCase and snake_case ([https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/serializer.html#camelcase-to-snake-case])\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Example:\r\n\r\n```tex\r\nThe expression\r\n\\[\r\n    \\Chi(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - g(X) + \\langle c_1(L), [X], \\rangle\r\n\\]\r\nis more complicated, so I indent it.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is also the universal convention for `equation`, `align`, etc.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be useful if (the very useful command) `vimtex-env-change-math` (i.e. `cs$`) would automatically adjust the formatting. That is `cs$\\[<CR>` on inline math inserts three new lines containing `\\[`, `    ` + the math, and `\\]` respectively. Analogously it would be handy if `cs$$<CR>` on a displaymath expression such as\r\n```tex\r\n\\[\r\n    \\Chi(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - g(X) + \\langle c_1(L), [X], \\rangle\r\n\\]\r\n```\r\nwere to convert it to a single line $\\Chi(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - g(X) + \\langle c_1(L), [X], \\rangle$ (though its not clear whether completely inlining it into the surrounding text is desirable).\r\n\r\nIt would probably be best to make the format-aware `cs$` optional. I was thinking that it could depend on the argument provided to the command, i.e. `\\[ ` is format-aware while `\\[` remains the same.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAn alternative solution to this problem (I'm not sure if this has been implemented already) would be to have a functionality that allows (de-)inlining math.",

         "There are a few engine images by name e.g. `longhornio/longhorn-test:version-test.4-3.3-3.1-1` and `longhornio/longhorn-test:upgrade-test.4-3.3-3.1-1` are used by Longhorn integration test, e.g. [here](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-tests/blob/2129e3860e22d9627af4823abf54062a35d8e8d4/manager/integration/tests/test_engine_upgrade.py#L404) and [here](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-tests/blob/2129e3860e22d9627af4823abf54062a35d8e8d4/manager/integration/tests/test_engine_upgrade.py#L609) . So far those images are manually built using scripts at https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-tests/tree/master/manager/test_containers .\r\n\r\nThe compatibility test images are built using https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-tests/blob/master/manager/test_containers/compatibility/generate_version_image.sh .\r\n\r\nThe upgrade test image is a bit more complicated. It requires a manually tagged engine image (https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-tests/blob/master/manager/test_containers/upgrade/generate_live_upgrade_image.sh#L4 ) to act as the base. And this manual tagged engine image cannot have the same Git commit ID as an existing engine image. So normally what we did is:\r\n1. Clone the latest Longhorn engine\r\n2. Add one more commit to it.\r\n3. Build it locally.\r\n4. Tag the image to e.g. `longhornio/longhorn-engine:live-upgrade-4-3-1` then run the build script.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we also need to update the version number by hand. For example, the current vanilla engine version output is something like:  \r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/longhorn version --client-only\r\n{\r\n\t\"clientVersion\": {\r\n\t\t\"version\": \"dbe126f\",\r\n\t\t\"gitCommit\": \"dbe126f4ad5cd7aa2277537ed2aec64827523573\",\r\n\t\t\"buildDate\": \"2020-09-21T21:44:36+00:00\",\r\n\t\t\"cliAPIVersion\": 4,\r\n\t\t\"cliAPIMinVersion\": 3,\r\n\t\t\"controllerAPIVersion\": 3,\r\n\t\t\"controllerAPIMinVersion\": 3,\r\n\t\t\"dataFormatVersion\": 1,\r\n\t\t\"dataFormatMinVersion\": 1\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"serverVersion\": null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should be able to update the version automatically based on the output of the current version.\r\n\r\nSo ideally, we should able to generate the correct build of engine test images by providing the engine repo to it, so the script can:\r\n1. Pull the repo\r\n2. Add a commit to generate a different Git commit\r\n3. Compile (simply build & package is enough. we can skip the test since it's upstream engine)\r\n4. Use the version output to generate the correct compatible test engine image names as well as the upgrade test engine image, for both AMD64 and ARM64.\r\n\r\nAnd those can be done on the basis of necessity.\r\n\r\nI am thinking probably we can use a Jenkins job to do it manually, instead of relying on Drone. It's possible to do it through Drone if it detects the version change, but there can be incompatible changes in the same release cycle, so it's better if we can trigger the build manually.",

The code <em>may</em> still work, and\nnon-invasive patches to keep it working will be considered. However, more\nmodern tools no longer support old Node.js versions making testing difficult.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Removed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BREAKING</strong>: Remove <code>util.getPath</code>, <code>util.setPath</code>, and <code>util.deletePath</code>.\n<code>util.setPath</code> had a potential prototype pollution security issue when used\nwith unsafe inputs. These functions are not used by <code>forge</code> itself. They date\nfrom an early time when <code>forge</code> was targeted at providing general helper\nfunctions. The library direction changed to be more focused on cryptography.\nMany other excellent libraries are more suitable for general utilities. If\nyou need a replacement for these functions, consier <code>get</code>, <code>set</code>, and <code>unset</code>\nfrom <a href=\"https://lodash.com/\">lodash</a>. But also consider the potential similar\nsecurity issues with those APIs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.9.2 - 2020-09-01</h2>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>util.setPath</code> security note to function docs and to README.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SECURITY</strong>: The <code>util.setPath</code> function has the potential to cause\nprototype pollution if used with unsafe input.\n<ul>\n<li>This function is <strong>not</strong> used internally by <code>forge</code>.</li>\n<li>The rest of the library is unaffected by this issue.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not</strong> use unsafe input with this function.</li>\n<li>Usage with known input should function as expected. (Including input\nintentionally using potentially problematic keys.)</li>\n<li>No code changes will be made to address this issue in 0.9.x. The current\nbehavior <em>could</em> be considered a feature rather than a security issue.\n0.10.0 will be released that removes <code>util.getPath</code> and <code>util.setPath</code>.\nConsider <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> from <a href=\"https://lodash.com/\">lodash</a> if you need\nreplacements.

I'm doubting it's the application, but the touchscreen test and calibration tools all work fine. When I run screen.py, however, the touchscreen buttons don't work at all. If I set the application resolution to 320x240, the touch registration areas are rotated 90 degrees, right along the side edge of the screen, so only a selection are accessible. I surmise that at 480x320, they're off the edge of the screen completely. Is this something you've run into with the AdaFruit screen and do you have any suggestions? The documentation is kind of a mix of old (LCD plate) and new, so piecing it together is a little challenging.",

         "### Describe the feature would like to see added to OpenZFS\r\n\r\nWhen using an low-latency device (e.g. Optane drive) together with normal flash devices in a mirror, the reads should preferentially (almost always) go to the low-latency device, with the other flash devices just acting as redundancy.\r\n\r\nA typical use-case for such a mirror is as the allocation classes special vdev, i.e. for meta-data and small files.\r\n\r\nWith #4334 this was handled for asymmetric mirrors consisting of SSD+HDD combinations, by using the hint from the linux kernel that HDDs are rotational, while SSDs are not, and then preferentially use the non-rotational device (SSD).  This heuristic however does not work when all involved deviced are non-rotational flash.\r\n\r\nA workaround is possible by marking the slower devices as rotational in the kernel (`echo 1 > /sys/block/sdX/queue/rotational`), before importing the pool.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if such a hint about individual devices can be provided within OpenZFS, similar to the write-mostly mark in linux software raid.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it would perhaps be possible to use the response time statistics already available in the linux kernel, as shown by `r_await` with `iostat -x` to dynamically choose a prefered device, when the response times differ significantly.\r\n\r\n### How will this feature improve OpenZFS?\r\n\r\nBetter performance at lower cost (only one low-latency device needed per mirror).\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nSSD and normal NVME devices typically have read latencies around 100 microseconds.  Optane devices have latencies around 10 microseconds.  This can have a considerable impact on read performance:\r\n\r\nOn one tested filesystem without and with the above workaround, listing all files (`time find . -type f > allfiles.txt`) shrunk from 23.1 to 16.5 seconds after fresh pool import.  Also, having preselected a list of 10000 files (most of them small), reading them (`cat allfiles_10000_1.txt | time xargs -n 100 md5sum > /dev/null`) was reduced from 10.9 to 7.1 seconds.  A 30-35 % improvement.  (In this test, 5 % of the used space is in the allocation class special device.)  \r\n\r\nThis was tested on Debian buster, amd64, with ZFS 0.8.4-2~bpo10+1.  (I have not found any changelog messages or commits which suggest that behaviour has changed since.)",

I will open one issue for every feature I want to request.\n\n**Describe the feature you want** \n\nTook me a while to find share button. But, it works well. The arrow icon with the share below, that is.\n\nOnly issue is why this is not also used  in pop-up player?\nFull video player\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ce5GtPu.jpg)\n\nvs\nPop-Up\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7gDNEGu.jpg)\n\nIs it not possible to have the same implementation in both?\nIt should be logical that the same design should be continued, so that users will not be confused where to find those buttons \n\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it** \n\nThere is no share button in pop-up player.\nUser needs to click on Full player icon (So, there is space for an icon🤔🤨)\nThen click on arrow icon, then click on share.\nApp does not use same logic and implementation for similar issue.\nThe space required is the same for an arrow button and a full screen button, so that should not be a problem.\nIf there is not enough space, just do not show it, same as other icons already bein displayed - Resolution, Speed, Full screen\n\nThe only change would be for the full screen button to be  under the umbrella of the arrow key on the right, along with share button ...\n\nHaving the arrow key beside the full screen icon should not be a problem, either:\nFull player icons:\n![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/aa460109f5d9650cce92d7da8c81d810d944232a/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f465452314975532e706e67)\n\nPop-up player icons:\n![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6c72249bc13d661e610a4263881380ba16ed7018/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f67686e465a73562e706e67)\n\n**How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?** \n\nUsers will be able to directly share a video from pop-up player.\nApp will use same design and logic for screen icons/buttons so no confusion across different players\n",

But I get the error as seen in the pic above. Both recursive and isolated updates fail\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior:\r\n\r\npnpm updates every other package ignoring my local workspace packages.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior:\r\n\r\npnpm fails to update deps\r\n\r\n### Additional information:\r\n\r\n - `node -v` prints: v15.1.0\r\n - Windows, macOS, or Linux?: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n",

Donc, le `société`=titre du modèle openfisca peut porter à confusion.\r\nCeci d'autant plus que le terme \"entreprise\" est employé dans Camino.\r\n\r\n**Et si on renommait `société` en `titre` et qu'on ajoutait une entité `entreprise` ?**\r\n\r\nCe serait mieux mais `titre` ne serait pas encore l'entité pivot. Pourquoi ? \r\nCe n'est pas l'élément le plus petit manipulé permettant de faire ensuite des calculs groupés de redevances à l'échelle de la commune ou du département.\r\n\r\nC'est qu'un titre minier peut être : \r\n* sur plusieurs communes (dont un lieu principal d'exploitation ?).\r\n* recouvrir l'extraction de plusieurs substances.\r\n\r\n**Est-ce que le terme `filon` conviendrait ?** \r\n\r\nNope. Pourquoi ?\r\nSi l'on prend l'exemple d'un bloc d'or, celui-ci contient potentiellement d'autres substances (substances connexes ?) qui peuvent être exploitées/vendues par l'entreprise.\r\n\r\n**Quelle est donc l'entité minimale ?** \r\n\r\nCette entité qui : \r\n* a un titre d'exploitation unique,\r\n* est sur le découpage géographique le plus fin désigné par la loi (a priori, commune, tel que pour les redevances)\r\n?\r\n\r\nVoire, en plus : \r\n* a une substance unique,\r\n* est exploité par une seule entreprise (garanti par le titre d'exploitation unique si un titre n'a qu'une entreprise ; à vérifier)\r\n?\r\n\r\n### Voici des informations qui peuvent aider à reproduire le problème :\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contexte\r\n\r\nJe m'identifie plus en tant que :\r\n\r\n- [ ] Contributeur·e : je contribue à OpenFisca France — Fiscalité Minière.\r\n- [ ] Développeur·e : je crée des outils qui utilisent OpenFisca France — Fiscalité Minière.\r\n- [ ] Économiste : je réalise des simulations avec des données.\r\n- [ ] Mainteneur·e : j'intègre les contributions à OpenFisca France — Fiscalité Minière.\r\n- [ ] Autre : _(ajoutez une description du contexte dans lequel vous utilisez OpenFisca)_.",

         "## Description\r\nHaving a consumption rate limiter for a table is beneficial in two ways:\r\n1. Currently offline tables can be configured to have storage quota. The storage quota for tables safegaurds the pinot cluster hosting those tables in case of excessive uploads of offline segments so that the cluster won't be under provisioned. Consumption rate limiter can play similar role for hybrid tables and realtime-only tables as it limits the amount of data being ingested into the realtime tables.\r\n2. Bursty pattern of incoming Kafka events introduces long time GC pauses on Pinot server. This behavior has been observed in some tables in LinkedIn. It's also been reported in this issue: #6138.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces rate limit on Kafka consumption which can be configured in StreamConfig. The consumption rate limit parameter is defined for the whole topic and the rate limit for each partition will be simply topic rate limit divided by the partition count of that topic.\r\n\r\n## Testing Done\r\n- Locally added consumption rate limit to `LLCRealtimeClusterIntegrationTest` and verified the consumption rate was limited the the amount set in the table config.\r\n- Deployed to a perf cluster with two servers, one with rate limit enabled and one without. Here are some chart comparing a few metrics on the two hosts (red: w/o consumption rate limit, blue: w/ consumption rate limit):\r\n1) Ingestion rate for a period of two hours when incoming message rate was more than the consumption rate limit specified in the table config:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8548220/151083771-40074150-41b8-4287-9498-4eec712757aa.png)\r\n2) Young generation GC collection time for the same time period.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8548220/151084300-b1c4f7d0-d1a0-49ad-b75d-077dcaf69563.png)\r\n3) Young generation GC count for the same time period.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8548220/151084394-51a0c332-fed5-41ed-949e-6fc6bf56d9bc.png)\r\n4) other metrics like old gen gc metrics, cpu utilization, ... were pretty much identical.",

The reason is that with each seeking the history and playlist fragment is reloaded. Since this feature increases the frequency such high reloading is noticeable.\r\n\r\nIt could be fixed if the lists fragments apply changes to single items instead of reloading the whole list. But that should be done in another PR, probably by changing to the Groupie library.\r\n\r\n#### APK testing (2020-12-01)\r\nWhen you try it, please make sure you haven't opened the history or playlist detail fragments opened (also in tabs).\r\n[Releases page](https://github.com/vkay94/NewPipe/releases/tag/YT-Rewind-Forward)\r\n\r\nHere are some visuals for the 2020-12-01-version with its states:\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6626210/99855951-3e8e6c80-2b88-11eb-95c9-5fbca85a356d.png\" width=\"500\" class=\"center\" /><br>\r\n<em>Normal video frame for reference</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6626210/99855582-7812a800-2b87-11eb-8d2d-9dea17b9de28.png\" width=\"500\" class=\"center\" /><br>\r\n<em>Playing + dark arc shadow</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6626210/99856172-b066b600-2b88-11eb-809c-10fa29940ebd.png\" width=\"500\" class=\"center\" /><br>\r\n<em>Paused + controls were visible (shadow + dark transparent arc)</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSo let's continue discussing it here with the view of the code implementation ;)\r\n\r\n#### Due diligence\r\n- [x] I read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/HEAD/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n",

See example\r\n\r\n```\r\nAn execution plan has been generated and is shown below.\r\nResource actions are indicated with the following symbols:\r\n-/+ destroy and then create replacement\r\n\r\nTerraform will perform the following actions:\r\n\r\n  # gitlab_project_mirror.test_moving_mirror must be replaced\r\n-/+ resource \"gitlab_project_mirror\" \"test_moving_mirror\" {\r\n        enabled                 = true\r\n      ~ id                      = \"22846482:259337\" -> (known after apply)\r\n        keep_divergent_refs     = false\r\n      ~ mirror_id               = 259337 -> (known after apply)\r\n        only_protected_branches = false\r\n        project                 = \"22846482\"\r\n      ~ url                     = (sensitive value)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPlan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is a new mirror is created in gitlab with each apply. The old mirror is disabled, creating a list of disabled mirrors.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nPlease list the steps required to reproduce the issue, for example:\r\n# initial add of mirror\r\n1. `terraform apply`\r\n2. `terraform apply`\r\n\r\n# with no changes made to TF\r\n3. `terraform plan`\r\n4. `terraform apply`\r\n\r\n### Important Factoids\r\nAre there anything atypical about your accounts that we should know?

I've personally had at least two events where I was stranded due to this, one while camping (and it only took 6-8 hours for my Prius's tiny battery to drain).\r\n\r\nLead-acid batteries will reduce their usable lifespan if drained past 50% depth of discharge by up to half, and especially considering starting batteries are even more vulnerable (non\"deep-cycle\"). At 10~ total discharges due to issues with OP over the last year, my Prius's battery is now in need of (costly) replacement.\r\n\r\nConsider at even 173mA, a brand new Prius/Prime 12v battery will be at 50% charge after just 5.5 days, something the battery is not designed for (more calculations in above issue)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7257172/101217581-9c728800-364f-11eb-989d-355d8f70104d.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7257172/101220516-ccbc2580-3653-11eb-841a-9f1bf0efa5a6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Ideas to resolve**\r\nImplement a LVD in comma power to switch off power at 11.7 volts; for example, or even further upstream in Uno.

         "Per the finding from NCC:\r\n\r\nWhen using a software wallet, elliptic curve operations may leak information about the private keys associated with a Blockstack wallet through timing side-channels.\r\n\r\nThe Stacks Wallet implementation allows two ways for users to manage their wallet private keys and sign transactions. First, they can use the Ledger hardware wallet, which integrates with the Stacks Wallet application. Second, they can choose to use the Stacks application itself to manage their keys and sign transactions. In the latter case, the stacks-transactions library is used to sign transactions. The underlying signing function is as follows:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28991/99553544-8eb9d300-29be-11eb-9443-8c26442bd0f8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that for this software signing, the Javascript elliptic library is used for ECDSA over\r\ncurve secp256k1. A common flaw in ECDSA implementations is side-channel leaks. A focus\r\nof cryptographic literature and study in recent years, side channel leaks occur when some\r\ncomputation over secret data leaks into the world through physical channels which are not\r\ndefined by the abstract model of the software - one such example is timing leaks. Timing attacks have caused severe breaks in cutting-edge cryptographic implementations . In gen-eral, a requirement for cryptographic implementations to avoid being broken by timing leaks is that their computations which involve secret data must not have data-dependent execution time, in other words they must be constant-time.\r\n\r\nThe elliptic library is not constant-time, and there are several immediately apparent timing leakages: first, for secp256k1, the implementation of scalar multiplication is in JavaScript, which tends to have innate issues with constant-time cryptography. Second, private scalars are represented using bn.js, which is inherently non-constant-time as it uses non-modular big integers, so operations with private scalars such as the private key itself or the per-signature nonce k will leak information about their values. Lastly, the implementation of elliptic curve scalar multiplication itself in elliptic.js for secp256k1 uses the wNAF method, which is known to be leak information about the scalar through side channels.\r\n\r\nThe practical impact of this finding is limited, but it may be more impactful if the user who is using the Stacks wallet is doing so on a machine that has multiple trust domains, such as a shared server.\r\n\r\nA simple solution is to limit the use of software wallets, or emphasize the security tradeoffs thereof. The timing leak can be removed from the software wallet by using an implementation of ECDSA which is known to be constant-time, such as the well-tested libsecp256k1 which is used in the Bitcoin core project ,3 which can be compiled to WebAssembly to be run in the Stacks wallet.",

They have to explicitly check for my messages (which they do with usually great delay).\r\n\r\nFor one of them, I tried to figure out the issue by looking at their iPhone and following the troubleshooting steps [found here](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318711-Troubleshooting-Notifications).

Does (local, not GIT) projects sync through the regular VS Code sync normally work?\r\n\r\nSo far, natively, your project manager saves the 'projects.json' in the user folder in the VS Code folder, and as far as I experienced, the regular settings sync (not the plugin/extension) done through the Microsoft account won't sync projects from one machine to another. I understand I can set \"projectManager.projectsLocation\" to accept a different place, and I did just that with a folder I sync through another service. Just wanting to know, is there something wrong on my end that VS Code doesn't want to sync projects by the normal MS sync?",

The Appsmith instance themselves are running behind firewalls & it's not possible for users to provide SSH access to the maintainers to debug their instance. We, as a maintainers, should make it easy for the users to share relevant data with the team. Some of the task items as part of this list are:\r\n* Improve logging by attaching the sessionId & userId to the log statements. This is being done via the MDC context but because we use Spring webflux, a particular request can span multiple threads. We don't log the MDC reliably across different threads. \r\n* Have a command to grep & dump these logs in a shareable format with Appsmith maintainers.\r\n* Potentially, collect the client logs and log them on the server as well so that we get client information as well.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen users running Appsmith in a self-hosted environment run into any issues, they reach out to the maintainers on Discord/Github issues. At this juncture, all the debugging performed by the maintainers is in an ad-hoc fashion. This needs to be improved. \r\n\r\n## Additional Context",

The reason is that with each seeking the history and playlist fragment is reloaded. Since this feature increases the frequency such high reloading is noticeable.\r\n\r\nIt could be fixed if the lists fragments apply changes to single items instead of reloading the whole list. But that should be done in another PR, probably by changing to the Groupie library.\r\n\r\n#### APK testing (2020-12-01)\r\nWhen you try it, please make sure you haven't opened the history or playlist detail fragments opened (also in tabs).\r\n[Releases page](https://github.com/vkay94/NewPipe/releases/tag/YT-Rewind-Forward)\r\n\r\nHere are some visuals for the 2020-12-01-version with its states:\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6626210/99855951-3e8e6c80-2b88-11eb-95c9-5fbca85a356d.png\" width=\"500\" class=\"center\" /><br>\r\n<em>Normal video frame for reference</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6626210/99855582-7812a800-2b87-11eb-8d2d-9dea17b9de28.png\" width=\"500\" class=\"center\" /><br>\r\n<em>Playing + dark arc shadow</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6626210/99856172-b066b600-2b88-11eb-809c-10fa29940ebd.png\" width=\"500\" class=\"center\" /><br>\r\n<em>Paused + controls were visible (shadow + dark transparent arc)</em>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSo let's continue discussing it here with the view of the code implementation ;)\r\n\r\n#### Due diligence\r\n- [x] I read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/HEAD/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n",

Due to limitations\n  imposed by our API, we cannot completely mitigate this vulnerability and a\n  future release will contain a new API which is designed to be resilient to\n  these for contexts where it is required. Credit to **Hubert Kario** for\n  reporting the issue. *CVE-2020-25659*\n* Support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 has been removed. Users on older version of OpenSSL\n  will need to upgrade.\n* Added basic support for PKCS7 signing (including SMIME) via\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.PKCS7SignatureBuilder`.\n<p>.. _v3-1-1:</p>\n<p>3.1.1 - 2020-09-22\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Windows, macOS, and <code>manylinux</code> wheels to be compiled with\nOpenSSL 1.1.1h.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _v3-1:</p>\n<p>3.1 - 2020-08-26</p>\n<pre><code>\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Removed support for ``idna`` based\n  :term:`U-label` parsing in various X.509 classes. This support was originally\n  deprecated in version 2.1 and moved to an extra in 2.5.\n* Deprecated OpenSSL 1.0.2 support. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is no longer supported by\n  the OpenSSL project. The next version of ``cryptography`` will drop support\n  for it.\n* Deprecated support for Python 3.5. This version sees very little use and will\n  be removed in the next release.\n* ``backend`` arguments to functions are no longer required and the\n  default backend will automatically be selected if no ``backend`` is provided.\n* Added initial support for parsing certificates from PKCS7 files with\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`\n  and\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`\n  .\n* Calling ``update`` or ``update_into`` on\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext` with ``data``\n  longer than 2\\ :sup:`31` bytes no longer raises an ``OverflowError``. This\n  also resolves the same issue in :doc:`/fernet`.\n<p>.. _v3-0:</p>\n<p>3.0 - 2020-07-20\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

(Model Garden official or research directory)\r\n- [x] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed.\r\n\r\n## 1. The entire URL of the file you are using\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection/model_main_tf2.py\r\n\r\n## 2. Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI trained an Efficientdet D2 object detection model using my own TFRecord dataset with 12 classes. When I ran the validation loop (`model_main_tf2.py` with the `checkpoint_dir` parameter) the ground truth images in Tensorboard all had 100 boxes visualized even though only few were provided by the validation dataset.\r\n\r\nAll of the extra boxes have the class id 1 (with text \"additional-panels\" in my dataset). I confirmed this by checking the values of groundtruth_boxes and groundtruth_classes here:

truth boxes are correct. It looks like the culprit is this line here where `label_id_offset` is added to the class ids: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/model_lib_v2.py#L707\r\nOr maybe the bounding box visualization function should ignore these zero-area \"padding\" boxes.\r\n\r\n## 3. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI can't provide the TFRecord files I'm using but this should be reproducible with any dataset where the labels start with id 1 as instructed here: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/using_your_own_dataset.md#label-maps\r\n\r\n1. Train one checkpoint with the Efficientdet D2 config provided in the \"Additional context\" section.\r\n2. Run the evaluation: `model_main_tf2.py --checkpoint_dir=<checkpoint_dir> --pipeline_config_path=<pipeline_config_path> --model_dir=<model_dir>`\r\n3. Run Tensorboard with --logdir=<model_dir>\r\n4. Look at the IMAGES tab in Tensorboard and see a bunch of extra zero-area ground truth bounding boxes in the bottom left corner (see attached image).\r\n\r\n## 4. Expected behavior\r\n\r\nOnly the ground truth boxes in the validation set should be visualized.\r\n\r\n## 5.

The device seems to be correctly installed & active.\r\nI'm using jSerialComm provided by [fazecast.github.io - jSerialComm-2.6.2.jar](https://fazecast.github.io/jSerialComm/binaries/jSerialComm-2.6.2.jar).\r\n\r\nI can't get it managed to run.

DropDown list gets correctly filled. I selected COM10.\r\n2. The log tells me `Port \"COM10: USB Serial Port (COM10) (FT232R USB UART)\" is now closed.` altough #open is called.\r\n3. I typed a into the send bar and hit send.\r\n4. The Exception as in title `com.fazecast.jSerialComm.SerialPortIOException: This port appears to have been shutdown or disconnected.` occurs. Always.\r\n\r\nWhat's going wrong here?\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Meanwhile i implemented basically the same logic in C# with the .NET Framework & System.IO.Ports. It's working perfectly, so hardware faults are not a possible cause.

         "**Describe the bug**\r\nRecently I am no longer able to download from Baidu Cloud Storage. Used to work flawlessly without any issues and today I was able to download one file by using a small workaround. The link in \"Local Chain/本地直链\" didn't appear like usually when I select a file I need and decided to select the file again and press Download directly in the Baidu Cloud Storage to let it generate a link and that actually fixed it and a direct download link in \"Local Chain/本地直链\" appeared. Used IDM and the file downloaded successfully. Tried to replicate the workaround to download another file but it didn't work and no matter if I clear all my cookies in my browser and login again, nothing has fixed the issue and I am no longer able to download from Baidu. Downloading fails after some time in the script menu too. EDIT: After trying several times for hours, it started to download the second file. Could have been an extension conflict.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n - Simply try to use the script as usual with Tampermonkey and you will not be able to download directly with IDM\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n - After selecting a file, a link should appear in \"Local Chain/本地直链\" and successfully download with IDM\r\n\r\n**Screenshot**\r\n![Screenshot (20)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5103276/101625310-82ec8a00-3a1b-11eb-873c-3e27dd84333f.png)\r\n![Screenshot (21)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5103276/101625468-bc24fa00-3a1b-11eb-8228-97c15aef04ad.png)\r\n![Screenshot (22)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5103276/101628066-8e41b480-3a1f-11eb-8592-ea3706f10bfd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop**\r\n - OS: [Windows 10 Home 20H2]\r\n - Browser: [Microsoft Edge Version 87.0.664.57 - Official build - 64-bit]\r\n - Downloader: [Internet Download Manager Version 6.38 Build 14]",

I'm rather new to Kubernetes and all so I've been working on setting this up to help me learn it all. \r\n\r\nI can get it to work using the image of Wordpress that has Apache included (Wordpress:latest) but I rather use NGINX ingress to do the lifting instead of the built in Apache so this is the reason I'm trying to get it to work. Also good to learn a little more complex setup with Nginx ingress.\r\n\r\nIt seems that once all manifests are applied I visit localhost and I see this, ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS.

After you select which game you want to play it gives only white screen. When you press alt+enter to smaller screen then image comes back and works normally. If you go back to full screen again the image just freezes. So the game is still running, only the screen hangs. \r\n\r\nThis issue seems to be only with vulkan renderer. Opengl works fine.\r\n\r\nLast working build was: 0.0.13-11232\r\n0.0.13-11234 has this problem. \r\n\r\nMy pc is:\r\ncpu: i7-7700k 4.20ghz\r\nram: 16gb\r\ngpu: amd radeon r9 200 series.

The machine then gets stuck in a reboot loop because theres now now OS on the disk (its blank).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1343\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/813389/101681867-b8fd2e80-3a5a-11eb-9555-1977a076b5bf.png\">\r\n\r\nNow if you just resize disk via UI while machine is on, it just changes size, it doesn't create a new one, so im not sure why terraform is behaving like this.\r\n\r\nYou can also see on the zfs dataset that its created an extra one, didnt delete the original either, it just created another disk then removed original (just not data).  It should of just adjusted the size of the original and not reaplce it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@pve01:~# zfs list|grep 27\r\nrpool/prod/vm/vm-271050-cloudinit   135K  5.62T      135K  -\r\nrpool/prod/vm/vm-271050-disk-0     1.35G  5.62T     1.35G  -\r\nrpool/prod/vm/vm-271050-disk-1     99.5K  5.62T     99.5K  -\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat should of happened is, it should of just adjusted the size of disk-0.\r\n\r\nTo duplicate this issue easily, you can see my example code below.  Just change size after initial build and re-apply to see issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/blob/master/docs/resource_vm_qemu.md\r\n\r\nterraform {\r\n  required_providers {\r\n    proxmox = {\r\n      source  = \"telmate/proxmox\"\r\n      version = \"~> 2.6.5\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nprovider \"proxmox\" {\r\n  pm_parallel       = 4\r\n  pm_tls_insecure   = true\r\n  pm_api_url        = var.pm_api_url\r\n  pm_password       = var.pm_password\r\n  pm_user           = var.pm_user\r\n}\r\n\r\nresource \"proxmox_vm_qemu\" \"vm\" {\r\n\r\n  #\r\n  # Machine Specifications\r\n  #\r\n\r\n  count             = 1\r\n  name              = var.vm_hostname\r\n  desc              = var.vm_desc\r\n  vmid              = var.vm_id\r\n\r\n  target_node       = var.pm_node\r\n\r\n  cpu               = var.vm_cpu\r\n  numa              = true\r\n  memory            = var.vm_memory\r\n\r\n  cores             = var.vm_cores\r\n  sockets           = var.vm_sockets\r\n\r\n  clone             = var.vm_template\r\n  full_clone        = true\r\n\r\n  pool              = var.vm_pool\r\n\r\n  agent             = 1\r\n  os_type           = \"cloud-init\"\r\n\r\n  hotplug           = \"network,disk,usb,memory,cpu\"\r\n  scsihw            = \"virtio-scsi-pci\"\r\n  bootdisk          = \"scsi0\"\r\n  boot              = \"c\"\r\n\r\n  disk {\r\n    slot            = 0\r\n    size            = \"20G\"\r\n    storage         = \"prod-vm\"\r\n\r\n    type            = \"scsi\"\r\n    ssd             = \"true\"\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  vga {\r\n    memory = 0\r\n    type   = \"serial0\"\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  #\r\n  # Connectivity\r\n  #\r\n\r\n  # net/linux (vLAN 4001)\r\n  network {\r\n      model = \"virtio\"\r\n      bridge = \"vmbr1\"\r\n      tag = 4001\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  network {\r\n      model = \"virtio\"\r\n      bridge = \"vmbr1\"\r\n      tag = 4002\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ipconfig0 = \"ip=${var.vm_ip}/24,gw=${var.vm_gw}\"\r\n  ipconfig1 = \"ip=172.27.2.50/24\"\r\n\r\n  # Terraform\r\n  ssh_user = \"ubuntu\"\r\n  ssh_private_key = file(\"${path.module}/keys/id_rsa_terraform\")\r\n\r\n  # User public SSH key\r\n  sshkeys = file(\"${path.module}/keys/id_rsa_netspeedy.pub\")\r\n\r\n  provisioner \"remote-exec\" {\r\n\r\n    connection {\r\n      type     = \"ssh\"\r\n      user     = \"root\"\r\n      host     = var.vm_ip\r\n      private_key = file(\"${path.module}/keys/id_rsa_terraform\")\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    inline = [\r\n      \"ip a\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  #\r\n  # Lifecycle\r\n  #\r\n  lifecycle {\r\n    ignore_changes  = [\r\n      network\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny ideas on fix? \r\n\r\nOnly solution I have right now is to ignore the disks and manually make changes but that kinda defeats the object of terraform.",

         "Dear,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thanks for developing all tools around the AMR++ pipeline!\r\nI have a few questions surrounding the steps after RGI main. So RGI main seems to work well, no error there. When I run RGI main (loaded from a conda environment) simply on the command line with the file from ExtractMegaResSNP/SNP_files/fixed_snp.fasta I get sensible output in both .json and .txt file. So that all seems well. However, the pipeline doesn't function properly when there are no perfect hits found, as then no further directories are created, so no 'final' files are obtained. The first failed step in the pipeline is the SNP confirmation (as reported here https://github.com/meglab-metagenomics/amrplusplus_v2/issues/5). \r\n\r\nSo my questions are:\r\n\r\n- If no perfect hits are found, does this simply mean that I can continue with the original read counts from the ResistomeResults and simply remove the genes & read counts where it says SNPConfirmationRequired, since they are not confirmed? I would find this somewhat surprising though, as there are several genes for which my Gene Fraction is 100 (so should completely overlap with the reference sequence), but no perfect hits are found. This would be very important to know, as if so, I can just continue!\r\n\r\n- Also by separately installing the newest RGI version just a few days ago, running it on the fasta file found in ExtractMegaResSNP/SNP_files/fixed_snp.fasta and then going through the file, no 'perfect' hits are found. This sort of strengthens the findings as well right, that no perfect hits are found and that therefore the genes requiring SNP Confirmation can be thrown out of the count matrix? Basically all hits are \"loose hit with at least 95 percent identity pushed strict\". The only strange thing is that in none of the samples I tested there would be a specific SNP confirmed, while in each sample there are quite some gene candidates requiring SNP confirmation (with huge number of hits). Or is this something you encountered before and is quite normal?\r\n\r\n- Looking at the log files, it goes wrong at the \"amr_long_to_wide.py: error: argument -i/--input_files: expected at least one argument\", since the input here is supposed to be the file with perfect hits. Hope this is sufficient information about my error!\r\n\r\nBest and thanks a lot in advance!\r\nQuinten\r\n",

So when I change the name of on of them, all the linked buttons apply this change\r\n\r\n**Usecases**\r\nWe control a PTZ camera and use its presets. For example, preset 1 for speaker, preset 2 for piano, preset 3 for drums, and so on.\r\nOn page 1 are the buttons we need before the event starts and on page 2 the buttons we need during the event.\r\nOn both sides we have eight buttons to access the camera presets 1-8. On side 1 there is also a button that goes to page 99, where again there are eight buttons for the presets, but this time a button press means that the camera saves its position as preset number x.\r\nSo for the speaker, there is a button on page 1 and 2 to recall the preset and a button to set the preset on page 99. Now if I want to change the name of a preset (e.g. guitar instead of drums), I have to change the names of all three buttons one by one.\r\n\r\nThis is my first time opening an issue, please give any advice, what I should do different.",

Please describe.**\r\nThe problem is stalled downloads being sat on forever with no resolution.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThere should be some user settings to deal with skipping stalled downloads.\r\nSomething like X amount of time stalled, and 'should this be blacklisted' I think would suffice.\r\nThat way if it's a legit reason (internet is down or whatever) and you choose to not blacklist the downloads it'll loop back and try it again eventually. So now you're more likely to get the files you want, and even if there's a legit reason for the issue that gets resolved later they will still continue to queue/search/download.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is regular manual policing of the queue to manually deal with them. This is made more annoying because if you delete the download from the DL client, radarr doesn't see it as failed (which would trigger a new search) it just gives up and lists it as missing. So you have to also tell it search again.\r\n\r\nAll of this adds up the antithesis of automation imo and any solution would be better than no solution.\r\n\r\n[AB#753](https://dev.azure.com/Servarr/7ab38f4e-5a57-4d70-84f4-94dd9bc5d6df/_workitems/edit/753)",

Adds the OnError method to the ResourceEventHandler interface so that the handler is notified of ListAndWatch errors. \r\n2.

Modifies the metadata informer factory and dynamic informer factory to start informers via `RunWithStopOptions()` and provides a way to retrieve the stop channel for given informer to determine when an individual informer is stopped. \r\n4. Refactors some CRD specific integration testing helpers out of the GC integration test into a shared util package so that RQ integration test can also use them without duplicating code.\r\n5. Modifies GC controller to recognize when a CRD informer has stopped and removes the monitor for it.\r\n6. Modifies RQ controller to recognize when a CRD informer has stopped and removes the monitor for it.\r\n7. Modifies controller-manager to run the GC and RQ controllers with RunWithStopOptions (meaning it always stops an informer upon reflector ListAndWatch error).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is tested manually by modifying controller-runtime to use the new interfaces. Also by running the resource quota controller and GC controller with the new interfaces to verify that the informer shuts down as expected.\r\n\r\nUnit testing has been added to the relevant pieces of tools/cache and metadatainformer/dynamicinformer. Integration tests for both the garbage collector and quota controller test that the install CRD/uninstall CRD/reinstall CRD flow continues to work while the informer gets stopped and restarted as expected.\r\n\r\n**Which issue(s) this PR fixes**:\r\n<!--\r\n*Automatically closes linked issue when PR is merged.\r\nUsage: `Fixes #<issue number>`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.\r\n_If PR is about `failing-tests or flakes`, please post the related issues/tests in a comment and do not use `Fixes`_*\r\n-->\r\nFixes #79610\r\nUnblocks work relating to https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/pull/1192\r\n\r\n```release-note\r\n1.

         "The backend server, originally written in Java just for the purpose of running the scenario compiler, has grown to considerable size in terms of new features. It now manages the assignment data model, and will soon be expanded with the Projects functionality, which brings another model and a file server. Thus, it makes sense to break apart the monolithic Java server into several smaller services:\r\n\r\n- [x] **Frontend** - this service only serves the static files for the frontend (html, js, css). It can be a simple Apache server.\r\n- [x] **Compiler backend** - HTTP frontend for the scenario compiler. Needs to be written in Java to call the scenario compiler efficiently. Provides the `POST /api/runcodegen` endpoint.\r\n- [x] **Project backend** - manages the Projects model and files. Should also provide the `POST /api/projectzip` endpoint since both require knowledge about project-specific files (`build.gradle`, `.gitignore`, etc.). Can be Java or NestJS (NestJS preferred for model management).\r\n- [x] **Assignment backend** - manages the Assignments model. Needs to communicate with the compiler backend for checking and grading solutions. Can be Java or NestJS (NestJS preferred for model management).\r\n\r\n### Open Questions\r\n\r\n- [x] How should the various backends communicate (e.g. assignments → runcodegen)? Preferably async messaging like Kafka.\r\n- [x] How should version information be available to the frontend? Currently, this is done by replacing `$$version$$` tags in the generated JS files as part of resource bundling. A viable option is a new endpoint provided by the backend.",

         "I realize numpy is using experimental compilers for native builds on the M1, and still has some [bugs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17964), so it might be premature to discuss optimizations. Perhaps this is a feature request and not a bug. However, one would expect that native ARM code would typically be at least as fast as translated x86-64 code. I noticed that the [nibabel bench_finite_range.py](https://github.com/nipy/nibabel) test is much slower for the native code than translated code. I found translated code (Python 3.8.3, NumPy version 1.19.4) is x10 faster than native code (Python 3.9.1rc1, NumPy version 1.19.4)\r\n### Reproducing code example:\r\n\r\n```#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom numpy.testing import measure\r\n#example where translated code (Python 3.8.3, NumPy version 1.19.4) is x10 faster than native code (Python 3.9.1rc1, NumPy version 1.19.4)\r\nrng = np.random.RandomState(20111001)\r\nimg_shape = (128, 128, 64, 10)\r\nrepeat = 100\r\narr = rng.normal(size=img_shape)\r\nmtime = measure('np.max(arr)', repeat)\r\nprint('%30s %6.2f' % ('max all finite', mtime))\r\nmtime = measure('np.min(arr)', repeat)\r\nprint('%30s %6.2f' % ('min all finite', mtime))\r\narr[:, :, :, 1] = np.nan\r\nmtime = measure('np.max(arr)', repeat)\r\nprint('%30s %6.2f' % ('max all nan', mtime))\r\nmtime = measure('np.min(arr)', repeat)\r\nprint('%30s %6.2f' % ('min all nan', mtime))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Performance:\r\n\r\nTranslated:\r\n```\r\n$ time ./numpy_native_slower_than_translated.py\r\n                max all finite   0.18\r\n                min all finite   0.18\r\n                   max all nan   0.18\r\n                   min all nan   0.19\r\n./numpy_native_slower_than_translated.py  1.32s user 1.28s system 214% cpu 1.213 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nNative:\r\n```\r\n$ time ./numpy_native_slower_than_translated.py\r\n                max all finite   1.98\r\n                min all finite   1.99\r\n                   max all nan   1.99\r\n                   min all nan   1.98\r\n./numpy_native_slower_than_translated.py  8.49s user 0.14s system 104% cpu 8.237 total\r\n```\r\n\r\n### NumPy/Python version information:\r\n\r\n<!-- Output from 'import sys, numpy; print(numpy.__version__, sys.version)' -->\r\n\r\nTranslated:\r\n - 1.19.4 3.8.3 (default, May 19 2020, 13:54:14) \r\n[Clang 10.0.0 ]\r\n\r\nNative:\r\n -  1.19.4 3.9.1rc1 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 28 2020, 22:21:58) \r\n[Clang 11.0.0 ]\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In particular, I'd like to see `kured` as the in-cluster reboot coordinator directing the local update-agent (Zincati) on each node. This possibly requires some enhancements on both sides, and I'll be happy to drive the changes on FCOS side.\r\n\r\nZincati core logic implements a finite-state machine: https://github.com/coreos/zincati/blob/v0.0.13/docs/images/zincati-fsm.png\r\nOne key point here is that an update is first staged, and only later explicitly finalized (with a reboot) based on the locally configured update strategy. This means that a random reboot (i.e. not triggered by Zincati) will not apply a staged update.\r\nIt currently offers a few upgrade strategies: https://coreos.github.io/zincati/usage/updates-strategy/\r\n\r\nOne option here could be kured to implement the [FleetLock protocol](https://coreos.github.io/zincati/development/fleetlock/protocol/), and point Zincati at it.\r\n\r\nAnother option could be that a new strategy is added to Zincati to signal the staged update with a file compatible with `--reboot-sentinel`, and then kured reboot logic is made configurable to write a file (allowing Zincati to finalize the update) instead of rebooting.",

         "This is not an issue per se. I'll just try to provide some additional information and answer some questions I received regarding the topics we had in the following [stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgWWbBUWyig).\r\n\r\n### Does the use of filters break the Open-Close Principle?\r\n\r\nThis is a totally valid question. If the intention by using the specifications is to conform to this principle, then by adding the concept of filters, aren't we doing the opposite? We go back and update the specification by adding additional conditions.\r\nAs a brief recap, the OCP predicates that we should have constructs that are open to extensions and close to changes. This means, if we need to add a \"behavior\" to a class, we should be able to do that without changing the class itself. Even more simplified, if you have switch statements and too many conditional logic; it might be a sign that the behavior is too much hardcoded, and might be refactored in a better way.\r\n\r\nIn our case, indeed we have too many conditions within the specification, so this concern is partially true. The catch here is that we have to do with single and atomic business requirement. The user has demanded from us that we change the behavior and add an additional condition by which the customers can be queried. The requirement is that the filters on the customer's UI page be extended. Whenever you have business requirement changes, undoubtedly you will have code changes in the domain model as well. That particular specification will change only when this exact business requirement changes, and never otherwise; it's wired up to this functionality only. Even though not the perfect structure, I might say it's an acceptable solution.\r\n\r\nThis is quite different from the case when you have to change/add/delete behavior in a \"classic\" repository, in which case in order to update one business requirement, you're forced to update a construct that holds a collection of business requirements. That clearly violates SRP and OCP.\r\n\r\n### Why using `ThenInclude` in one instance broke the application? What is the proper usage?\r\n\r\nIn one instance, while describing different usages we updated the specification by adding `ThenInclude` (as shown below), which in turn resulted in a runtime error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nQuery.Include(x => x.Stores).ThenInclude(x => x.Address);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error here has to do with the fact that `Address` property is not navigation, but a string property. Obviously, you should not include simple properties. And, this is the same behavior that you will have by using EF directly. Including simple properties won't result in a compile-time error but a runtime error. It's up to you to be careful, make proper usage of it, and thoroughly test your queries.\r\nWe can constrain this usage and throw an exception, but we don't want to alter the behavior that much. What if the EF in some further version makes use of this usage? So, the ultimate usage constraints should be the responsibility of the ORM you're using.\r\n\r\n### How many Include statements are OK to have?\r\n\r\nThis is not directly related to this package, but I'll try to answer anyhow.\r\nWhile creating JOINs in SQL, the real issue is not about how many tables, but the cardinality. If the dependent tables are configured as one-to-one relationships, that's quite OK. But if you're including dependent tables, where there are many rows for each principal row, then it can have quite an impact on the performance. On top of that, you should be careful what SQL queries are being produced by EF as well. The EF Core 1&2 uses split queries, while EF Core 3 uses a single query. If you have a lot of 1:n relationships and use a single query, then you might end with a \"cartesian explosion\" (consider split queries in these cases).\r\n\r\nDuring the stream, I showcased the following specification, and the question was if this is OK?\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class AwbForInvoiceSpec : Specification<Awb>\r\n{\r\n    public AwbForInvoiceSpec(int ID)\r\n    {\r\n        Query.Where(x => x.ID == ID);\r\n        Query.Include(x => x.Packages);\r\n        Query.Include(x => x.AwbCargoServices);\r\n        Query.Include(x => x.AwbPurchase);\r\n        Query.Include(x => x.CargoManifest);\r\n        Query.Include(x => x.Customer).ThenInclude(x => x.Addresses);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the context of that particular application, the `Awb` has quite significant importance in the overall business workflow, and it might be a bit more complicated than it should be. First of all, the `AwbPurchase` and `CargoManifest` represent 1:1 relationships. So, we end up with two 1:n navigations. This is relatively OK if you're retrieving one Awb record (as in this case). On the other hand, if you're trying to get a list of records, then you should reconsider if you need the child collections or not. Try to measure the performance, consider the usage of the application, number of users, peak usages, etc, and then you can decide if that meets your criteria or not.\r\n\r\n### Anti-pattern usage\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the actual anti-pattern is not the usage of several Include statements, but including the `Customer`. That implies that Awb aggregate has direct navigation to the `Customer` aggregate. If you follow DDD, you should strive to have as independent aggregates as possible. If required, one particular aggregate should hold only the identifier of some other aggregate root and not have a direct reference.\r\n\r\nIn our case, it was a deliberate design decision to break this rule (for `Customer` aggregate), in order to improve the performance in particular cases and to reduce roundtrips to DB. But, it's not something I would advise you to do. Anyhow, it's up to you to weigh the pros/cons and make your own elaborate decisions for your applications.\r\n\r\n### Do I need private constructors for the entities (e.g. for the EF code-first approach)\r\n\r\nI got this question related to one particular scenario which happened during the stream. Once we added the `DateTime birthdate` parameter in the constructor, we were forced to add an additional parameterless constructor so the EF could work properly.\r\n\r\nEF requires a parameterless constructor, so it can create the instance of the entity and then populate the properties. So, it might be wise always to add one private parameterless constructor.\r\nIn our case it was working totally fine without it since all the parameters were of type `string`, and EF could just pass `null` values while creating the instance. But, once the DateTime parameter was added, that was no longer true, EF no longer could create the instance.\r\n\r\n**[EDIT]**\r\nThe above explanation is completely wrong :), so just ignore it.\r\nIt turns out EF is smart enough to utilize the constructor and will try to pass the values as ctor arguments. That's how EF handles the immutability (if your props have only getters). But, the ctor arguments should be named the same as the properties. The first character can be lowercase, and that's ok, EF will map to it correctly. But, the case of the rest of the characters should be exactly the same. So, in our case, if we have named the argument `birthDate` instead of `birthdate`, would have worked with no issues.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic Customer(string name, string email, string address, DateTime birthdate)\r\n{\r\n    Guard.Against.NullOrEmpty(name, nameof(name));\r\n    Guard.Against.NullOrEmpty(email, nameof(email));\r\n\r\n    this.BirthDate = birthdate;\r\n    this.Name = name;\r\n    this.Email = email;\r\n    this.Address = address;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

It's still reproduced.\r\nhttps://github.com/TRIQS/dft_tools/issues/122\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm currently using Wien2k 19.2, after checking the dft_tool/triqs compilation the problem is still here. \r\nFollowing this issue #127, I tried to recompile lapw2 and executed `x lapw2 -almd` again.\r\n\r\nAlso, I removed all of the comments from website example file `case.indmftpr`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nBasically following the website example, \r\n\r\n1.

Patch-manager / leads, this PR is a no-op from a product\nperspective -- feel free to manually apply any labels (e.g. bugzilla/valid-bug) to help the\nPR merge as long as tests are passing. If the PR is labeled \"needs-ok-to-test\", this is\nto limit costs for re-testing these PRs while they wait for review. Issue /ok-to-test\nto remove this tag and help the PR to merge.\n\n__Detail__:\nThis repository is out of sync with the downstream product builds for this component.\nOne or more images differ from those being used by ART to create product builds. This\nshould be addressed to ensure that the component's CI testing is accurately\nreflecting what customers will experience.\n\nThe information within the following ART component metadata is driving this alignment\nrequest: [ose-cluster-autoscaler-operator.yml](https://github.com/openshift/ocp-build-data/tree/03ab3ccadb276636be8fd61a79a978500e62bf9c/images/ose-cluster-autoscaler-operator.yml).\n\nThe vast majority of these PRs are opened because a different Golang version is being\nused to build the downstream component. ART compiles most components with the version\nof Golang being used by the control plane for a given OpenShift release. Exceptions\nto this convention (i.e. you believe your component must be compiled with a Golang\nversion independent from the control plane) must be granted by the OpenShift\narchitecture team and communicated to the ART team.\n\n__Roles & Responsibilities__:\n- Component owners are responsible for ensuring these alignment PRs merge with passing\n  tests OR that necessary metadata changes are reported to the ART team: `@release-artists`\n  in `#aos-art` on Slack. If necessary, the changes required by this pull request can be\n  introduced with a separate PR opened by the component team. Once the repository is aligned,\n  this PR will be closed automatically.\n- Patch-manager or those with sufficient privileges within this repository may add\n  any required labels to ensure the PR merges once tests are passing. Downstream builds\n  are *already* being built with these changes. Merging this PR only improves the fidelity\n  of our CI.\n\nIf you have any questions about this pull request, please reach out to `@art-team` in the `#aos-art` coreos slack channel.\n",

I think this should be configurable per profile, like the bellStyle setting (<https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/2360>) is.\r\n\r\n* Alternatively, register Windows Terminal with the \"Change system sounds\" feature in Control Panel so that I can choose a sound there.

Install Istio control plane with an ingress gateway\n2. configure that gateway with a `Gateway` resource\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\n  name: foo\n  namespace: istio-system\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: foo\n  servers:\n  - hosts:\n    - 'a.example.com'\n    port:\n      name: http\n      number: 80\n      protocol: HTTP\n    tls:\n      httpsRedirect: true\n  - hosts:\n    - 'a.example.com'\n    port:\n      name: https\n      number: 443\n      protocol: HTTPS\n    tls:\n      mode: SIMPLE\n      privateKey: /etc/istio/certs/foo/tls.key\n      serverCertificate: /etc/istio/certs/foo/tls.crt\n```\n3. create a `RequestAuthentication` resource, specifying JWT authentication for the gateway\n```yaml\napiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1\nkind: RequestAuthentication\nmetadata:\n  name: foo\n  namespace: istio-system\nspec:\n  jwtRules:\n  - forwardOriginalToken: true\n    fromHeaders:\n    - name: Authorization\n      prefix: 'Bearer '\n    issuer: https://your.jwt.issuer\n    jwksUri: https://your.jwks.endpoint\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: foo\n```\n4. Create an `AuthorizationPolicy` resource, disallowing non-authenticated requests to the gateway\n```yaml\napiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1\nkind: AuthorizationPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: foo\n  namespace: istio-system\nspec:\n  action: ALLOW\n  rules:\n  - to:\n    - operation:\n        paths:\n        - /*\n    when:\n    - key: request.auth.claims[iss]\n      values:\n      - https://your.jwt.issuer\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: foo\n```\n5. create a `VirtualService` resource exposing your service behind the gateway with a `corsPolicy`\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1\nkind: VirtualService\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    app: bar\n  name: bar\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  gateways:\n  - istio-system/foo\n  hosts:\n  - a.example.com\n  http:\n  - corsPolicy:\n      allowCredentials: true\n      allowHeaders:\n      - foo\n      allowMethods:\n      - GET\n      - HEAD\n      - OPTIONS\n      allowOrigin:\n      - https://localhost\n      allowOrigins:\n      - exact: https://localhost\n      maxAge: 30m\n    route:\n    - destination:\n        host: bar.default.svc.cluster.local\n```\n6. make a cross origin request to the gateway with proper JWT token, notice that it _does_ return expected CORS response headers\n```shell\n$ curl -i \\\n  -H 'Origin: https://localhost' \\\n  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Method: POST,PUT' \\\n  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Headers: foo' \\\n  https://a.example.com \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <REDACTED valid token>'\n\nHTTP/2 200\naccess-control-allow-origin: https://localhost\naccess-control-allow-credentials: true\naccess-control-allow-methods: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS\naccess-control-allow-headers: foo\naccess-control-max-age: 1800\ndate: Fri, 04 Dec 2020 22:44:59 GMT\nserver: istio-envoy\n```\n7. make a cross origin request to the gateway WITHOUT proper JWT token, notice that it _DOES NOT_ return expected CORS response headers\n```shell\n$ curl -i \\\n  -H 'Origin: https://localhost' \\\n  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Method: POST,PUT' \\\n  -H 'Access-Control-Request-Headers: foo' \\\n  https://a.example.com \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <REDACTED expired token>'\n\n\nHTTP/2 401\ncontent-length: 14\ncontent-type: text/plain\ndate: Fri, 04 Dec 2020 22:47:15 GMT\nserver: istio-envoy\n\nJwt is expired\n```\n\nAlthough the response code and response body may be different, the same behavior is observed wrt missing CORS headers for missing token, invalid token and expired token.\n\nPlease help us understand if there is a way to get these authentication and authorization failure responses to include the CORS headers configured in our VirtualService.\n\n**Version** (include the output of `istioctl version --remote` and `kubectl version --short` and `helm version --short` if you used Helm)\n```shell\n$ istioctl version --remote\nclient version: 1.6.13\nfoo version: 1.6.13\ntelemetry version: 1.6.13\ntelemetry version: 1.6.13\nistiod version: 1.6.13\ndata plane version: 1.6.13 (X proxies)\n\n$ kubectl version --short\nClient Version: v1.19.3\nServer Version: v1.14.10-gke.50\n```\n\n**How was Istio installed?**\nusing `istioctl`\n\n**Environment where the bug was observed (cloud vendor, OS, etc)**\nGKE",

Is your feature request related to a problem? e.g., I'm always frustrated when [...]. If this is related to another GitHub issue, please link here too -->\r\n`torch.diagflat` will return a Tensor that is sparse, but stored as a dense Tensor.\r\nIt takes up a large amount of memory just to store, and for _most_ use cases of creating a diagonal matrix, it will stay mainly diagonal.\r\n\r\nHaving the option of creating the sparse Tensor should speed up computation for large Tensors, whilst not breaking existing code. In my research, this has led to some CUDA out of memory errors that `torch.sparse_coo_tensor` avoided.\r\n\r\n## Pitch\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nChange `torch.diagflat` function signature to:\r\n``` python\r\n torch.diagflat(input, offset=0, sparse=False) → Tensor\r\n```\r\nThis argument name could be `layout` for consistency with the [sparse docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/sparse.html), but I think this would be confusing as you might think you're declaring row/column-major here instead.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\n1. Create dense Tensor and make sparse, i.e. `torch.diagflat(input).to_sparse()` which may lead to out of memory errors\r\n1. Create Tensor individually by values via generators in torch.sparse_coo_tensor` which is less practical, e.g.:\r\n  ``` python\r\n>>> x = torch.arange(5)\r\n>>> torch.sparse_coo_tensor(torch.tensor([(i, i) for i in range(len(x))]).T, x)\r\n  ```\r\ncc: #9674\n\ncc @aocsa @nikitaved @pearu @mruberry",

         "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen a user using walletconnect on our dapp - sends a transaction - only SOMETIMES does it actually appear and notify them in their wallets that they have a transaction to sign. \r\n\r\nSometimes it won't appear at all for users. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nGo to mintable.app - connect metamask via walletconnect.\r\nGo to browse, find an item and try to buy that item. (You'll need an account created tho)\r\nTransaction will appear once you press buy \r\n\r\nWallet may or may not have a transaction appear. \r\n\r\nUsing any other wallet - trust wallet, rainbow, or others - they appear immediately and without issue. \r\n\r\n\r\nTried disabling the walletconnect session, tried restarting metamask and restarting the connection via walletconnect on the site. \r\n\r\nTried disconnecting and reconnecting. Nothing seems to affect it. \r\n\r\nTL;DR - when disconnecting every session on metamask mobile - it will send the transaction on a fresh connect - after reloading the dapp and trying to send another transaction - nothing will appear in Metamask. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n_provider: WalletConnectProvider\r\naccounts: [\"0xBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx57\"]\r\nbridge: \"https://bridge.walletconnect.org\"\r\nchainId: 1\r\nconnectCallbacks: []\r\nconnected: true\r\ncurrentBlock: {number: Uint8Array(3), hash: Uint8Array(32), parentHash: Uint8Array(32), nonce: Uint8Array(8), mixHash: Uint8Array(32), …}\r\nhttp: HTTPConnection {_events: {…}, _eventsCount: 2, _maxListeners: undefined, url: \"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"}\r\ninfuraId: \"cxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxe\"\r\nisConnecting: false\r\nnetworkId: 1\r\nqrcode: true\r\nqrcodeModalOptions: undefined\r\nrpc: null\r\nrpcUrl: \"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/c7xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd our contract call:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  const contractInstance = await getDeployedContract(ABI, address);\r\n    return contractInstance.methods[methodName](...params)\r\n      .send(transactionDetails)\r\n      .on(\"transactionHash\", (txhash) => {\r\n                .............\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: WalletConnect team has told me this is a problem with metamask and need to bring it up here opposed to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe context of the example is: \r\n\r\nUser connects to the dapp via wallet connect to their metamask. Metamask shows \"do you want to connect\" and does so. We can access their account and balance, etc. \r\n\r\nUser tries to make a contract call, the transaction object is exactly the same as for metamask browser, coinbase wallet, trust wallet, fortmatic - but when its sent to the user's phone from walletconnect <> metamask mobile - nothing appears on their phone at all. \r\n\r\nSometimes if you disconnect and refresh the app then reconnect - it will send it once, but if you reload the page or come back in a few minutes - it won't send the transaction to their phone\r\nFor example - I just closed all my connections on metamask, then i reloaded the dapp - reconnected to metamask - and then submitted a transaction - and it was sent to metamask. \r\n\r\nNow I'm going to reject this transaction - reload the dapp and try to send it again. \r\n\r\nI'm asked to reconnect my wallet - I select walletconnect - no QR code is needed as its already got an active session,  web3 is working - I can see the account in metamask mobile, I can fetch data using web3 from the contract - but when I submit the transaction to call the contract - nothing. Nothing happens, the dapp is showing its awaiting tx confirmation from the user - but the metamask mobile app doesnt have a transaction to accept. It never receives it",

         "在WebView下拉刷新的时候，如果html中还有自己的下拉，那在SmartRefreshLayout中就会出现各种问题。我解决了这个问题，给大家分享一下解决方案。\r\n首先自定义WebView，代码如下：\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport android.content.Context;\r\nimport android.util.AttributeSet;\r\nimport android.view.MotionEvent;\r\nimport android.webkit.WebView;\r\n\r\npublic class MyWebView extends WebView {\r\n\r\n    public interface RefreshStateListener {\r\n        public void refreshState(boolean canRefresh);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private RefreshStateListener refreshStateListener;\r\n\r\n    public void setRefreshStateListener(RefreshStateListener refreshStateListener) {\r\n        this.refreshStateListener = refreshStateListener;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public MyWebView(Context context) {\r\n        super(context);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public MyWebView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {\r\n        super(context, attrs);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public MyWebView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyleAttr) {\r\n        super(context, attrs, defStyleAttr);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public MyWebView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyleAttr, int defStyleRes) {\r\n        super(context, attrs, defStyleAttr, defStyleRes);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void onOverScrolled(int scrollX, int scrollY, boolean clampedX, boolean clampedY) {\r\n        super.onOverScrolled(scrollX, scrollY, clampedX, clampedY);\r\n        if (refreshStateListener != null) {\r\n            refreshStateListener.refreshState(clampedY);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {\r\n        if (refreshStateListener != null && event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {\r\n            refreshStateListener.refreshState(false);\r\n        }\r\n        return super.onTouchEvent(event);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n使用非常简单，只需要在你的WebView那里加上一句代码即可。\r\n\r\n```Kotlin\r\nwebView.setRefreshStateListener {\r\n    refreshLayout.setEnableRefresh(it)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n目前没有发现任何问题，可以尝试使用百度首页测试。",

         "# Summary\r\n\r\nHi, I wrote a ocrserver based on `gosseract` (frontend page based on `https://github.com/otiai10/ocrserver`), below description all can be found in https://github.com/lzw5399/ocrserver.\r\n\r\nThere is a demand that OCR the received pdf base64 string, so I add the [https://github.com/gen2brain/go-fitz](https://github.com/gen2brain/go-fitz) depandency to convert the pdf to image（png) page by page, then use gosseract recognize the image. but after `go-fizt` was added I found the jpeg related functionality didn't work well, It seems have version conflict.\r\nThanks in advance for any help ^-^\r\n\r\n- combine the go-fizt & gosseract\r\n![](http://pic.codepie.fun/img/20201105184036.png)\r\n- then `client.SetImageFromBytes(bytes)` will return below error\r\n![](http://pic.codepie.fun/img/20201105150656.png)\r\n- after `docker exec` , and run `find -name '*libjpeg*'` I can't find any `libjpeg 90` related files.

         "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen using the collections organization, I still have parent/child pages within the collection, (using `has_children: true` on the parent and `parent: Page Name` in the child page). This appears as expect in the menu. However, for every collection *except* the last collection (by menu/config order), the table of contents on the parent page is empty (though it still displays the TOC title) and the breadcrumbs on the child pages do not correctly link to the parent page (they appear to have no `href` set).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create 2+ collections in the config. eg:\r\n  ```yaml\r\n  collections:\r\n  programming:\r\n    permalink: \"/:collection/:path/\"\r\n    output: true\r\n  projects:\r\n    permalink: \"/:collection/:path/\"\r\n    output: true\r\n\r\n  just_the_docs:\r\n  collections:\r\n    programming:\r\n      name: Programming\r\n    projects:\r\n      name: Projects\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Within the first collection folder (`_programming` in this example), create 2 files.\r\n\r\n`index.md`\r\n```markdown\r\n---\r\nlayout: page\r\ntitle: Parent Test\r\nhas_children: true\r\n---\r\n\r\nShould have a TOC that includes the child page, but it's empty.\r\n```\r\n\r\n`child.md`\r\n```markdown\r\n---\r\nlayout: page\r\ntitle: Child Test\r\nparent: Parent Test\r\n---\r\n\r\nBreadcrumbs on this page should link to the parent page but don't.\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. When loaded, these pages will have the TOC/breadcrumb issues I describe. But if you move these two files to the last collection (as ordered in `just_the_docs` in the config file), they TOC/breadcrumbs will behave properly.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThere should be a TOC/proper breadcrumbs for child/parent pairs in all of the collections.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n- OS: Pop OS 20.10\r\n- Using latest just-the-docs release (0.3.3) and Jekyll 3.8.5",
